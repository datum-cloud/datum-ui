# GraphQL code generator

[@graphql-codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) is what generated everything in this directory, using the configuration `graphql-codegen.yml`. Comments were placed in the file during evaluation of the tool but you may want to lookup the respective definitions so you understand what controls what.

To get up and running you should be able to do a `npm install` in this directory which will setup all the necessary dependencies related to the plugins via the `package.json`, and running the generator can be completed via `npm run codegen` in this directory. If there are any errors with the configuration or your output it will update you within the terminal.

More to come!
